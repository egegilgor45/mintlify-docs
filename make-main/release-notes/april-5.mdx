### Improved app search

We're excited to introduce our improved in-product app search designed to help you discover apps and build scenarios faster!

What’s new:

*   Improved search speed and reliability.
    
*   Apps related to your search query show up in the app search window with added insight into available modules.
    
*   Your recently used apps move to the top for a speedy build.
    
*   The new right-hand bar gives you quick access to common tools and functions.
    
*   While creating or editing the scenario you see a new section in the list of apps called **Apps in scenario**. It helps you get quicker access to already used apps.
