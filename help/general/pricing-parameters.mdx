Usage allowance
---------------

Usage allowance is proportional to the number of operations that you purchase.

For every 10,000 operations, you receive a set amount of the parameters detailed below.

| Parameter | Entitlement per 10k operations licensed per month | Entitlement per 120k operations licensed per year |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Data transfer](pricing-parameters.html#UUID-f6dfa983-75ff-828f-b99e-b91c744e1b81_N61fd3591c6406) | 5 GB | 5 GB |
| [Data storage](pricing-parameters.html#UUID-f6dfa983-75ff-828f-b99e-b91c744e1b81_N61fd372f109af) | 10 MB | 10 MB |
| [Incomplete executions store](pricing-parameters.html#UUID-f6dfa983-75ff-828f-b99e-b91c744e1b81_N61fd36ed7decf) | 10 MB (2 GB maximum) | 10 MB (2 GB maximum) |
| [Webhook queue size](pricing-parameters.html#UUID-f6dfa983-75ff-828f-b99e-b91c744e1b81_N61fd39947f274) | 667 (10,000 maximum) | 667 (10,000 maximum) |

**Examples:**

If your subscription has 150,000 operations _per month_, you are entitled to:

*   75 GB of data transfer
    
*   150 MB of data storage
    
*   150 MB of incomplete execution storage
    
*   10,000 webhook requests in the queue
    

If your subscription has 1,200,000 operations _per year_, you are entitled to:

*   50 GB of data transfer
    
*   100 MB of data storage
    
*   100 MB of incomplete execution storage
    
*   10,000 webhook requests in the queue
    

Usage allowance calculation does not apply to the number of data stores. You can use up to 1,000 data stores per single organization, regardless of your plan. Note that the minimum size of one data store is 1 MB.

Make calculates data storage based on the number of your operations per month. For every 10,000 operations per month, you get 10 MB of data storage.

Customers with operations flexibility on annual plans such as Pro, Team, or Enterprise receive their usage allowance based on monthly operations. For example, an annual plan with 1,200,000 operations for the year has a data storage maximum of 100 MB because there are 100,000 operations per month.

If you are on the Free plan, you have 1000 operations per month, which equals 1 MB of data storage and 1 data store.
