### Improvements and changes

*   [Managing and rotating](access-management/saml-certificate-management.html "SAML certificate management")
     SAML service provider (SP) certificates became easier for the Enterprise customers. Organization owners can now activate, deactivate, copy, and download SP certificates within the SSO settings. They can also see which certificates are active. When it's time to rotate certificates, users will receive a notification from Make, giving them time to schedule the switch and minimize downtime.
    
    Additionally, we’ve extended the validity of SP certificates to three years, instead of just one.

### Fixed issues

*   Make built-in functions that use timezone information, like the `addDays` function, didn’t work in custom functions. We fixed the custom function’s context, so now you can use the date functions in your custom functions.
