description: The Make REST API allows using HTTP requests to access Make data and control the Make platform without opening its graphical interface. 
---

This allows you to embed Make features into your software, add features on top of the platform, and automate your tasks that you perform in Make. To use the Make API, you need an Make account. Once logged in, you can generate an authentication token and start making calls to the API.

The API allows you to interact with multiple Make resources. This documentation covers the following API resources:

- Connections
- Data stores
- Data structures
- Hooks
- Notifications
- Organizations
- Scenarios
- Scenarios folders
- Teams
- Templates
- Users

The following API resources are fully functional, but are not covered in this documentation yet:

- Custom apps
- Devices
- Keys
