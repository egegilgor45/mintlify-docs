title: Make API structure
---

The root URL of the Make API consists of three parts and looks as follows:

```
{environment_url}/api/v2/{api_endpoint}
```

### Environment URL
The environment of Make you work in. This can be the link to your private instance of Make, for example, https://development.make.cloud, or the link to Make (with or without the zone, depending on a specific endpoint), for example, https://eu1.make.com.

<Note>
Always use HTTPS in your API requests.
</Note>

### API version
The version of the API preceded by `/api/`

### Endpoint (with or without parameters)
Each endpoint represents a resource that you can work with. Endpoints contain required and/or optional parameters. The resources are described in detail in Make resources.
