The dashboard has the following:

1.  **Earning panel:** Displays the total earnings, balance amount, minimum payout, and organizations required to qualify for receiving the commission. Affiliates can click **Request payout** to receive the commission.
    
    <Note>
    If one of your commissions receives a refund, the dashboard reflects this change in your earnings. For example: Someone uses your link and purchases an annual plan. They then decide they want a monthly plan and contact Make. Make refunds them and adjusts your earnings
