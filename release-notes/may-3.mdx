### Improvements and changes

*   We’ve added a small but important improvement to the **Users** tab. Now you can filter users by their role at both organization and team levels. Simply click on the filter icon and select the role that you would like to see in the list.

### Fixed issues

*   Recently, when searching for modules in the scenario editor, the **Instant** tag was missing from instant triggers and they were mistakenly labeled as **ACID** (polling) triggers. This issue has been resolved, and it now works as expected.
